Welcome! 
I'm wilfred
I'll be your instructor in this tutorial

We’ve been at war for the 
cheese in this house 
for a while now. 

We’ve lost many but with 
YOU on our side 
I’m certain that we’ll win!
So here’s the deal... 

First, click on a tile to open the Strucuture Wheel!
And pick the structure you’d like to place on the map

Well done! 
You are getting the hang of it.

Every time you place a structure you spend gold. 
You get gold by eleminiating an enemy on the battlefield!

You can see how much gold you’ve got on the left side of your screen.

Careful! 
A horde of enemies has appeared. Protect the cheese from those rats!!

Nicely done!
I think you get the basics

If you ever need some extra information you can always check out the Ratary

Rotate Camera

Eliminate Tower

For now though get to work! We need to get this cheese back to base.

Meanwhile I’ll get back to eating some cheese
See ya later champ!
